    <h2>What Are SPDR Sectors?</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      SPDR (Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts) sectors are a family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that divide the S&P 500 into 11 major industry sectors. Each sector ETF groups companies that operate in similar parts of the economy, like Technology, Health Care, or Energy.
